Micha has noticed that some letter sequences like ing and tion among many
other combinations seem to appear frequently in commonly used words Such
patterns can be used as clues for deciphering encrypted messages However
trying to find the most common patterns can be a real challenge as she
visually scans sentences She would like a program that can flawlessly
complete the task and help her gather data
Micha will provide the text to be scanned along with a list of suspected common letter
sequences She would like to get a report showing the number of times specific sequences
were found in the text To make your task easier all punctuation marks including hyphens
and special characters have been eliminated and replaced by spaces if needed There could
be numbers in the text
In philosophical terms the UIL Computer Science Contest is a competition that challenges
students to apply programming concepts and skills as well as their knowledge of the designated
programming language The contest is also an opportunity for students to expand their knowledge
of computer science beyond the classroom and to foster their interest in the field
The contest was established in the 1990 91 school year with several goals in mind Among them were
the goals of further strengthening the UIL math and science program with a new technological
component and to support Texas public schools in meeting the growing demand for computer
education
The UIL contest was modeled in many ways on the College Boards Advanced Placement curriculum for
computer science and the foundations of the contest can still be found there For the first
eight years of its existence Pascal was the designated programming language for the contest
Beginning with the 1998 99 school year the AP curriculum moved to c plus plus and UIL Computer Science
did likewise Finally beginning in the 2003 04 school year the contest moved from c plus plus to Java
This keeps UIL Computer Science in line not only with the AP curriculum but also with trends in
collegiate computer science curricula and the professional programming community
Java is the designated programming language for UIL Computer Science
